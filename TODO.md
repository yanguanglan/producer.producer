# TODO

## General

- `validate`

    - check previous major/minor/bugfix version numbers

    - check for @license tag in file-level docblock

- when `changes = CHANGELOG.*`, to get the change notes for the release, regex
  to find a line with `## VERSION` on it, up til the next `## *` heading.

- allow an "api" config directive that says "github", "gitlab", or "bitbucket"
  so we don't depend on a particular URL

## New Commands
